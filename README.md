# OOTD - Out Of The Dumps

Recently, there was a reddit article on how a person decided he had reached the lowest point in his life and what he did to get *Out Of The Dumps*.
Essentially, it was a post detailing all the things he did to get back on the horse.
It was mostly a motivational post that detailed how he kept track of all the things he did in his life. It spoke about how to build habbits and train oneself to become better at keeping them. It's not a new concept but it helped me do a lot better with my days.

Part of the process was keeping track of our daily habbits. The OP had mentioned that he kept a bullet journal that was colour coded where he tracked his daily activities and weather it kept up to his habbit forming guidelines. 

For example, if one targets to drink 4ltr of water daily, and managed to only consume 2 litres, he would record it under a red bullet etc.

The purpose of this project is to build a very simple tool that would help me to keep these tabs for myself through a mobile app. I have also procrastinated learning programming in Golang. I thought this project would be a great way to build a full-fledged microservice architectured project as the backend and a VERY simple android layout for the same in an attempt to learn the language a bit better than I know right now.

Now, I hate android development from the bottom of my soul from it's first incarnation of a ameobea some 7 million years ago but I truely hope this project will change my perception of it. So here goes!
